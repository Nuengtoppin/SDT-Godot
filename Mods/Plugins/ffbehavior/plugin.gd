## Port of sby's ffbehaviorV3_1 Loader mod (Final Fellatio-style behaviour): as she runs out of air with him in her
## mouth her eyes roll up and open wide, the background darkens and her pupils shrink (with his depth or her air);
## while you hold her head she loses breath and air faster. Behaviour > Out of air, the Loader pack's values by
## default (each row's description says what off does), where each effect starts and ends is in values.cfg (the
## mod's keys).
## Adapted:
## - her gaze, eyelids and iris size are MOOD modifiers of value points (Her.gazeAngle, and the new Her.eyelidTarget,
##   Her.irisScale) instead of the mod writing them after her tick: the game eases her eyes towards them (the mod's
##   own slow lead-in to its first angle), she still blinks and winces, dialogue triggers and passing out win;
## - the background's colour is written only when it changes, and goes back to normal when switched off;
## - breath and air lost while held: one amount every tick (the mod: twice it every other tick), the air loss never
##   lowers how close she already is to passing out.
## Not ported: the mod's older timer mode (usepassout=0: eyes up and pull-off attempts on a timer while he hilts),
## "persist", and its clearing of the tears on her lower eyelid every tick (the game's own clearing follows the
## eyelids it eases).
