extends SDTExtension
## Built-in reimplementation of the Loader mod aimpenis (sby, V2): aim his penis up and down with the mouse, as in
## bukkake mode, without bukkake mode's cumming (Him > Penis, "Aim with the mouse", off by default like the mod).
## While his penis is out of her mouth, mouse up / down tilts it up / down, further than the game allows (10 more up,
## 30 more down, the mod's settings file as shipped). Written from its source.
## Port change: the mod ran his penis physics a second time each frame (pulling against the game's own step, hence
## its "speedrange" boost, and calling her tongue's push twice); here the aim goes into his tilt target once
## (value point Him.penisTiltTarget) at the strength the mod's two steps settled at, and the wider limits into
## Him.penisAngle.

const BONUS_UP := 10.0
const BONUS_DOWN := 30.0
## The mod's auto "speedrange" (2 + (up + down) / 12) over its two steps a frame: about half of it in one step.
const AIM := (2.0 + (BONUS_UP + BONUS_DOWN) / 12.0) / 2.0
