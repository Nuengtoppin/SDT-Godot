## derrdev: after sby's chokercollarresistanceV4, on the throat ring model (stage 3 of the throat ring plan): her
## collar is a ring on her throat (ThroatRings.collar: edges from the collar's picture, material and tightness kept
## for each collar). Behaviour > Resistance, "Collar holds her throat", off by default. While she wears a collar and
## it is on, through value points:
##   - Her.pushBack: past the collar's top edge her head is pushed back, by how far he is past it and how much the
##     ring holds (its tightness, less its stretch) - like the game's intro limit;
##   - Her.resistance: past the top edge pushing in is harder by what the ring holds;
## P043: the collar's front is a spring pushed by her throat (it lags, overshoots a little and settles), and one
## setting, "Collar stiffness" (0 soft band .. 1 metal, quick buttons Band / Leather / Metal), sets how a collar holds
## and gives for every collar (ThroatRings.set_stiffness).
##   - Neck.pointBulge (clamp, P041): between the collar's edges her neck's outline may push out only as far as the
##     collar allows (a little, more as it stretches and its picture widens; metal never), so the throat bulge does
##     not go through the collar: her neck bulges above it and, when he is deeper, below it, held in by the band,
##     with a soft step at each edge. A wide collar holds a wide band, a thin one a thin band.
## The ring stretches under his pressure (his width, more while he pushes, the swallow wave too) and gives way: a
## leather collar slowly, a band fast, metal never. "Collar stretches" (P042): her throat pushes the collar out and
## the collar follows it with a lag, to show how tight it is - the neck may press a few pixels into it, the collar
## gives way after it, as far as the ring's stretch lets it (up to 17.5 px fully stretched), and settles back when
## her throat does. Only the front moves: the back of the collar, at her nape, stays where it is (the mod widened
## the whole picture by the ring's memory, about a point 70 px behind its origin, so it stayed wide in the air). "Wince when it holds": she winces while it holds him back (the mod's option).
## Pressure comes from what he does, not from holding the mouse button (the mod's), so auto mode works the same.
## P044 (after playing it): a collar holds like her throat entrance, a wall across its band: past its top edge pushing
## in gets harder, up to WALL x what the ring holds at its bottom edge, and her head is pushed back while he is in the
## band; once through, it squeezes only a little. How far its front gives way comes from its softness at once (a soft
## collar gives with the first push, the ring's stretch adds to that), the spring is fast, and stiffness 0 is a collar
## that holds nothing and rides along with her neck. "Collar can break" (off by default: collars never break): a worn
## out collar snaps, then holds nothing and rides along like stiffness 0, until it is repaired (the button, another
## collar or another stiffness). At its edges the band blends into the free bulge over a few outline points, so big
## bulges keep a round step.
## P046: the wall has its own setting, "Collar resistance" (0 .. 0.3, ThroatRings.collar_wall): setting the stiffness
## (or a quick button) sets it to match (0.3 x stiffness), then it can be set apart. The wall also holds while she is
## passed out (Her.limpResistance; the game holds nothing then, so the collar let go when she passed out).
## Not taken yet: the dialogue line "collarresistance", the breath-below-50% option during the intro, reactions when
## it snaps.
